# Adopt GitHub Flow for software development process


## Context

To streamline our development process, improve
collaboration, and ensure that our codebase remains stable and high-quality, we
need to adopt a standardized workflow.


## Decision

We have decided to adopt the GitHub Flow for our software development process.
GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and
projects with efficient collaboration and deployment mechanisms.

The GitHub Flow consists of the following steps:

1. Create a new branch: For each new feature, bugfix, or task, create a new
branch from the main branch.
2. Commit changes: Make changes and commit them to the new branch, using clear
and descriptive commit messages.
3. Open a Pull Request (PR): When the work is ready for review, create a PR
against the main branch, allowing team members to review and discuss the
changes.
4. Review and discuss: Team members review the changes, provide feedback, and
suggest modifications if necessary. Iterate on the changes and push additional
commits to the branch as needed.
5. Merge: Once the PR is approved and all tests pass, merge the changes into
the main branch.
6. Deploy: Deploy the updated main branch to production or the appropriate
environment, and monitor for any issues.


## Consequences


### Positive Consequences:

1. Enhanced collaboration: GitHub Flow encourages collaboration by providing a
clear and straightforward process for reviewing and discussing changes.
2. Code stability: Changes are reviewed and tested before being merged into the
main branch, reducing the likelihood of introducing issues into production.
3. Incremental development: Small, manageable chunks of work are merged
frequently, allowing for more rapid iteration and continuous improvement.
4. Simplified deployment: With a clean main branch, deploying new features and
fixes becomes easier and more reliable.

### Negative Consequences:

1. Learning curve: Team members who are unfamiliar with Git or GitHub Flow will
need to invest time in learning the new workflow.
2. Overhead: For smaller teams or projects, the process may introduce some
overhead in terms of branching, reviewing, and merging changes.

Overall, adopting the GitHub Flow will improve our software development process
by enhancing collaboration, ensuring code stability, and simplifying
deployment. It is expected that the benefits will outweigh the potential
drawbacks, leading to a more efficient and effective development process.
